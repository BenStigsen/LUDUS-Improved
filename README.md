# LUDUS - Improved

An improved version of the system we use in school that contains our schedule, grades, absence, documents and much more.

This was made as a school project which also means that it's not an actual replacement for our system, but an ideal version of it. So a lot of the planned features aren't actually implemented.

The UI is written in Danish, all of the code and the node names are English.

## Requirements

Some specific requirements for the assignment:

- Must include gamification
  
  - Points _(Rewards and expectations)_ 
    
    - Depending on the amount your grades have improved as well as the lack of absence, you will have a points multiplier that you'll be able to use in a shop to buy stuff like student discounts for the next party
  
  - Absence Mystery _(Expectation)_
    
    - You will be able to see the absence for each week before the current one. So if you're more and more absent, you'd want to show up at school more since you're expecting the graph to go more downhill
  
  - _Discussed:_ Badges / Achievements (Rewards, goals, expectation)

- Must be written in Python (together with Tkinter)
  
  - Nope, asked the teacher if our group could create it in Godot since GDScript seems similar to Python and creating UI is simpler than Tkinter

- Must be able to read data (recommended SQL)
  
  - Lol nah, why use SQL when JSON is simpler?
